		<h3 class="ssh">1.2 <u>Identifier Names:</u></h3>
		
		<article class="text spacing">
			 The names of variables, functions, labels and various other user-defined items are called identifiers.
			<ul>
				<li>The first character must be a letter or an underscore.</li>
				<li>Subsequent digits must be either letters, digits or underscores.</li>
				<li>In C99, an external identifier has at least 31 significant characters and an internal identifier has at least 63 significant characters.</li>
				<li>An identifier name is case-sensitive.</li>
				<li>An identifier can't be a C keyword and can't have the same name as a function in the C library.</li>
			</ul>
		</article>
		
		<h3 class="ssh">1.3 <u>Types of Variables:</u></h3>
	
		<article class="text spacing">
			There are 3 types of variables:
			<br>
			<b>1. <u>Local Variables:</u></b> <br>
			Variables that are declared inside a function are called Local Variables.
		
			<h4 class="code"> <u><b>Code:</b></u></h4>
        	<textarea rows="13" cols="auto" readonly="readonly" class="ta">void func1(void)
{
	int x;
	x=10;
}
void func2(void)
{
	int x;
	x=-199;			
}
//x is a local variable.</textarea> 
        	<br> <br>
		</article>			
			
		<article class="text">
			<span class="snote spacing">NOTE:</span>
			If a local variable, say 's' is created when the control enters an if-block, it is destroyed upon exit. Furthermore, variable 's' will be known only within the if-block and it can't be referenced elsewhere - even in other parts of the  same function containing it. <br> <br>
		
			When a variable declared within an inner block has the same name as a variable declared by an enclosing block, the variable in the inner block hides the variable in the outer block.
		
			<h4 class="code"> <u><b>Code:</b></u></h4>
        	<textarea rows="16" cols="auto" readonly="readonly" class="ta">
int main(void)
{
int x=10;
if(x==10)
{
	int x; 	   //this hides the outer x
	x=99;
	printf("Inner x: %d\n",x);
}
printf("Outer x: %d\n",x);
return 0;
}</textarea>
		<br><br>
		
		The program will display the output:<br>
		Inner x: 99<br>
		Outer x: 10<br> <br>
		Thus the inner <b>x</b> and the outer <b>x</b> are 2 separate and distinct objects. Once that block ends, the outer <b>x</b> once again becomes visible. 
		</article>
		<br> <br>
		
		
		<article class="text">
			<b>2. <u>Formal Parameters:</u></b> <br>
			If a function is to use arguments it must declare variables that will accept the values of the arguments. These variables are called the formal parameters of the function. They behave like any other local variables inside the function. 
		</article>
		<br><br>
	
		<article class="text">
			<b>3. <u>Global Variables:</u></b> <br>
			Global variables are known throughout the program and maybe used by any piece of code. If there's a variable say - 'count' has been declared globally. Now if in a function, the variable 'count' is declared again, then the function will not make use of the global variable and instead refer to the local variable.<br>
			If a global variable and a local variable have the same name, all references to that variable in that code block in which the local variable is declared will refer to that local variable only and have no effect on the global variable.
			<br>
			Storage for global variables is in a fixed region of memory set aside for this purpose by the compiler. Global variables are helpful when many functions in a program use the same data. You should avoid using unnecessary global variables since they take up memory the entire time the program is executing, not just when they're needed.

		<h3 class="ssh">1.4 <u>The Four C Scopes:</u></h3>
	
		<article class="text spacing">	
			The 2 terms - <i>local</i> and <i>global</i> are more finely subdivided in C into 4 categories:
			<br> <br>
			<table id="t2" class="table" width="auto">
				<tr class="th">
					<td>Scope</td>
					<td>Meaning</td>
				</tr>
			
				<tr class="tableNormalRowFormatting">
					<td>File Scope</td>
					<td>Starts at the beginning of the file and ends with the end of the file. It refers to only those identifiers that are declared outside of all functions i.e., they're global. File scope identifiers are visible throughout the entire file.</td>
				</tr>
			
				<tr class="tableNormalRowFormatting">
					<td>Block Scope</td>
					<td>Begins with the opening { of a block and ends with its closing }. However, block scope also extends to function parameters in a function definition that is function parameters are included in a function's block scope variables with block scope. Variables with block scope are local to their block.</td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr class="tableNormalRowFormatting">
					<td>Function Prototype Scope</td>
					<td>Identifiers declared in a function prototype are visible within the prototype.</td>
				</tr>
			
				<tr class="tableNormalRowFormatting">
					<td>Function Scope</td>
					<td>Begins with the opening { of a function and ends with its closing }. Function scope applies only to labels. A label is used as the target of a <i>goto</i> statement and that label must be within the same function as the <i>goto</i></td>
				</tr>
